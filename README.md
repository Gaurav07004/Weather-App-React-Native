# Weather-App-React-Native

I aimed to create a user-friendly experience for accessing accurate weather information from anywhere in the world. Using the ability of React Native, I built a cross-platform application that works easily on Android devices.

Key Features:
Global Coverage: Explore weather conditions for cities and towns worldwide.
Real-Time Updates: Stay informed with the latest weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.
Hourly and Daily Forecasts: Plan your activities effectively with detailed hourly and daily weather forecasts.
Extended Forecast: Get a 7-day forecast to help you prepare for the week ahead.
Location-Based Weather: Receive weather details based on your location or search for specific areas.
